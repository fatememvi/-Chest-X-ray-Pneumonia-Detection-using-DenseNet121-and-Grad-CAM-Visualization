# -Chest-X-ray-Pneumonia-Detection-using-DenseNet121-and-Grad-CAM-Visualization
This project implements a deep learning pipeline to automatically classify pediatric chest X-ray images into Normal and Pneumonia categories. Using DenseNet121 with transfer learning, the model achieves high accuracy while mitigating class imbalance through weighted loss functions and data augmentation
